# Voronoi-Based-Pursuit-Simulation
## Voronoi Escape Dynamics

This project explores a dynamic chase scenario within a Voronoi diagram setting. Here, the player moves through a field of enemy zones, where each enemy is responsible for the region defined by their Voronoi cell. An enemy only pursues the player when they enter its region, while other enemies remain stationary in their assigned cells. The project analyzes the relationship between the player's speed (v2v_2​) and the enemy's speed (v1v_1​) to determine the critical escape threshold, where the player can just barely evade capture. By examining the interaction between speeds and Voronoi regions, this study contributes to fields such as game theory, path optimization, and AI pursuit-evade strategies.
